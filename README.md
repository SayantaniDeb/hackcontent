## Inspiration

We were inspired by the growing desire among content creators with respect to editing tools and software,need to collaboration and make an impact to the society.
## What it does

CreativeMate is a website designed to help content creators with hashtag creation, content ideas, and collaboration. The website is divided into several sections, each offering different features to aid content creation.

The first section is the hashtag creator. Here, content creators can enter a keyword related to their content and generate relevant hashtags to use in their postsThis feature is useful for content creators who struggle with coming up with effective hashtags to increase their content's reach.

The second section is the content ideas section. This feature is helpful for content creators who may be stuck in a creative rut or are simply looking for fresh ideas to incorporate into their content.

The third section is the collaboration section. Here, content creators can connect with other creators to collaborate on projects, share ideas, and offer feedback.This feature is useful for content creators who want to expand their network and work with like-minded individuals to create high-quality content.

## How we built it

CreativeMate was built using ReactJs and Tailwind CSS which involved several steps. First, we planned and designed the website, including the layout, features, and content that were to be included. This step was crucial for creating a clear vision of what the website would look like and how it would function.

Next, we set up the development environment by installing the required software.

We built the website by creating components and laying out the structure of the website. This involved using ReactJs to create dynamic components such as text box. We then styled the website using Tailwind CSS, applying the predefined styles we had configured to the components we had created.

Chatengine.io API was used for the collaboration section of the website.We also integrated OpenAI API for content ideas. This tool used advanced machine learning algorithms to generate content ideas based on specific keywords or topics.

Once the website was complete, we tested and debugged it to ensure that it functioned correctly and looked as intended. Finally, we deployed the finished website to a hosting service Vercel, to make it accessible to the public.

## Steps to run
 
 ``yarn install``
 
 ``yarn start``
 
### To make the Hashtag work:

- Add your own API from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Put your newly generated apiKey inside Hashtag.js 


 ``const apiKey = ""; // replace with your actual API key``



##  Challenges we ran into

Building a project can present various challenges, depending on the scope and complexity of the project. During the development of our project, we encountered some common challenges that developers often face, including:

Project requirements: We had to ensure that the project met the client's requirements and expectations, which required a clear understanding of the project's goals, objectives, and scope to meet the client's expectations.

Time and resource constraints: We had to build the project within a specific timeframe and with limited resources. To overcome this challenge, we planned the project carefully, allocated resources efficiently, and managed our time effectively to ensure that the project was completed on time and within budget.

Technical complexity: Our project involved complex technical requirements, such as integrating with third-party systems(API) or developing custom functionality. We had to ensure that we had the necessary technical expertise to meet these requirements and resolve any technical challenges that arose.

## Accomplishments we're proud of


We are proud of creating an app that addresses the need for Content Creators. We were able to build a platform that connects creators with each others and provide them tools and services which overcomes their problems
## What we learned

Throughout the development process, we learned a lot about the ways content creators create their content and how we can change with with the use of algorithms.
## What's next for CreatorMate

We can add more functionalities such as AI based voice generator which generates voices based upon the users requirements in frequency.We can all add on an AI based video maker which can make a video based on the description given to it.This will bring upon a huge impact on the community of Content creators
